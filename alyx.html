        <p class="cardtext">I played the final three hours of Half-Life: Alyx in a single session. Before Alyx, I never used VR for more than 30 minutes at a time. I don't get motion sick but I do get generally tired of VR. Tired of having a hunk of plastic strapped to my face, of having to stand and stoop and reach awkwardly around, of not being able to check my phone or have a sip of coffee. But I didn't take a break, or even want to, during the final chapters of Half-Life: Alyx. I wasn't tired. I was completely enthralled and unwilling to stop playing.</p>
        <p class="cardtext">When I played through the ending (no spoilers here, but trust me, you'll want to keep your VR headset on through the credits), I reloaded my last autosave and played through the ending a second time. And then I went back to the beginning of the game and started playing again. I didn't have much doubt Half-Life: Alyx would be a great VR experienceâ€”Valve makes its own VR headset and software, after all. But I was skeptical it could also be a great, proper Half-Life game, and I was thrilled to discover it really is. While it's sandwiched between the events of Half-Life 1 and Half-Life 2 the repercussions of its story extend well into whatever future there is for the Half-Life series, and its technical accomplishments will leave other developers, once again, struggling to keep up.</p>

        <br><br><br><h4>On a rail</h4>
        <p class="cardtext">Five years before the events of Half-Life 2, Alyx Vance is performing surveillance and recon in the Combine-controlled City 17. It's immediately engaging to be back in City 17 again, so familiar yet so much more impressive in VR, an environment I don't need to just look at to admire but one I can actually run my virtual fingertips across and crane my neck back to take in fully. When a city scanner takes my picture I instinctively hold my hands up against its blinding camera flash. Combine Metro Cops seem larger than life because they're now actually life-size. I've seen Striders before but I've never had one step over me in VR as I stared up at it, utterly dumbfounded, watching it sink its massive feet into the side of a building, using the crumbling masonry as a step to walk itself up to a rooftop. The opening minutes, and at plenty of times during the entire game, I just had to stop, stand still, and take it all in.</p>
        <br><img src="Picture Resources/ha3.jpg" width="70%" max-height="400px">
        <br><br><p class="cardtext">The attention to detail is obvious not just in how the world looks but in the ways you can interact with it. Alyx's disembodied hands react wonderfully to each object in the world, and it's hard not to just stand there admiring the way my virtual fingers close in different ways depending on what I'm holding: curling around a bottle, gently clasping an iron railing, holding a discarded cigarette butt between my  thumb and forefinger, gripping an empty water jug by the handle, pulling up the antenna and then gently twisting the tuning knob on a radio. Even discovering I can pick up a marker to scrawl something on a dirty window pane, and then realizing I can use an eraser to wipe it off, is delightful. You could easily spend 15 minutes just messing around with the physical objects in the introduction, and that's exactly what I did.</p>
