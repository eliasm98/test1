        <h4>Destiny 2 Review</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="card-body" style="max-height: 2000;">
        <p><strong>We've beaten the campaign, bested the Leviathan Raid, and competed in the Trials of the Nine. Now it's time for the Verdict.</strong></p>
        <p class="cardtext">Destiny 2 succeeds where the original failed the most: its delivery of a story-driven campaign good enough to match its finely tuned first-person shooter gameplay and great looks. Gathering loot and upgrades through missions and activities with my Fireteam and then finally running the climactic Raid together was a blast. And every time I thought my friends and I were scraping the bottom of the content barrel, Destiny 2 teased us with more that was just a few Light levels away.</p>

        <br><br><p class="cardtext">From the opening moments, Destiny 2 delivers Dominus Ghaul, an excellent antagonist whose cruelty earns our fury by taking away everything that had been built up in Destiny and its expansions, including our Guardians’ Light. The campaign that follows is filled with brilliant cutscenes that give the cast an opportunity to show great emotional range, and you can hear the sadness and determination in their voices. Zavala (played by Lance Reddick) is unwavering in his plan to assault Ghaul, while Ikora (Gina Torres) seems distraught and near the point of giving up. That context gives both new and returning players a sensible reason to climb the Light-level based power ladder, whether for the first time or all over again. It kept me moving forward through fun missions set in eye-catching environments, including the exhilarating penultimate mission.</p>

       <br><br> <p class="cardtext">Meanwhile, a soaring soundtrack backs pulse-pounding missions before shifting gears to evoke a tinge of sadness. The sound design is impeccable overall, with rewarding splashes of glimmer each time you open a chest or a silencing of the ambient noise when you aim down sights. Every adjustment is important, giving you the audio information you need instead of overwhelming you with everything at once.</p>

       <br><br> <p class="cardtext">To challenge us on the way back to the top, Bungie’s laid out a wide range of avenues that include Public Events, PvP (player vs. player) in the Crucible, roaming world bosses, treasure chests, Lost Sectors, Adventure side-quests, patrols, planet-specific challenges, Flashpoints, Vanguard missions, Exotic Quests, Strikes (Destiny’s dungeons, basically), the Nightfall (a more elaborate take on Strikes), the lengthy campaign, and of course the Leviathan Raid (the biggest, most complex dungeon).
          Especially early on, there’s so much to do it’s almost overwhelming. I found myself frequently getting distracted from the activity I embarked upon by something enticing, like a roaming boss or public event that promised some quick loot. It’s a good problem to have, in that I never felt bored, but keep in mind these all seem targeted toward early Light level Guardians. While all of these battles will help get you to level 265, climbing to the max of 350 (the cap indicated in menu tips) is going to require tackling much tougher challenges like Leviathan, Nightfall, and Trials of the Nine – the endgame, in other words.</p>
