        <h3>League of Legends Guide</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="card-body" style="max-height: 3100px;">
        
        <p class="cardtext">League of Legends (LoL) has been around for ten years now, and is not going anywhere. With a booming playerbase, huge esports scene and deep lore, the League of Legends universe offers something for everyone. The current roster consists of over 150 unique playable characters, and with more always on the way, you’re sure to find a play-style that suits you.</p>
        <p class="cardtext">Unfortunately, the depth and complexity that has kept League at the top for a decade is also a deathtrap for new players. For those coming from other genres like shooters and single-player games, the learning curve is steep, and the lack of in-game learning resources doesn’t help. Without some patient friends to show you the ropes and help you through your first few games, League of Legends can seem hostile and unforgiving. Lower level games are often plagued by bot accounts and smurfs ready to flame you at a moment’s notice, making many potential players give up before they even give it a chance.</p>
        <p class="cardtext">Those that do commit to learning the basics are rewarded by a game that has expanded beyond just its small, three-laned map. The community and scene are constantly evolving, and is sure to offer years, if not decades of entertainment to come.</p>
        <h4> The basics </h4>
        <p class="cardtext">Before we dive into the more nuanced parts of the game, it’s good to know the simple stuff first. League of Legends is a team-based MOBA, which stands for Multiplayer Online Battle Arena. This genre was once full of a whole range of games, but it’s now been whittled down to just a few like Dota 2 and Heroes of the Storm, with League of Legends being the biggest of the bunch. Almost all MOBAs, including LoL, have the same win-condition; work as a team to destroy the enemy base before they do the same to yours. This can take anywhere from 15 minutes to as long as an hour, but the typical game is around 30 minutes long.</p>

        <br><br><p class="cardtext">In each match of LoL, there is a blue team and a red team, and players are randomly assigned to one of the two before each match. Each team has five players, and they all pick a character called a ‘champion’ to play as for that match. Each champion has a unique design, lore, and in-game abilities, as well as their own strengths and weaknesses. Some players love to play many different champions, while others will stick to just one for years and years. It all depends on you, and how you enjoy playing the game.</p>
        <p class="cardtext">Unlike other games like RPGs, where you stick to a certain character and power-up over time, LoL has no progression that carries over from one match to the next. Each game is a clean slate, with both teams doing everything possible to come out on top. This means that everything is down to you and your team’s skill; there are no pay-to-win items, and no high-level players to come and PK you in the starter zone. </p>
        <p class="cardtext">While there is no tangible progression between each match, the progression comes in your own growth and skill as a player. Those who enjoy improving their own play will find themselves right at home in LoL’s Ranked Solo/Duo queue mode, where you are pitted against other players of equal skill. </p>
        <img src="Picture Resources/ranks.jpg" width="80%">
        <br><br><p class="cardtext">There are nine different ranks to achieve: Iron, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Master, Grandmaster, and Challenger, where Challengers are the very best players on each server. As a result, the greatest reward for playing LoL is not a rare item with great stats or end-game loot like in other games, but the knowledge that you are better than a lot of other people. The mindset is similar to traditional sports, and this makes LoL one of the best competitive games, alongside titles like CS:GO, Rocket League, and COD.</p>
        <p class="cardtext">That doesn’t mean that every game has to be a try-hard filled sweat-fest though. For those who enjoy the more casual side, LoL offers low-stakes Normal queue games and wacky game modes like URF that come around once in a while. There is even the ARAM mode, where every player is assigned a random champion and thrown into a 5v5 bloodbath for some quick and chilled-out fun. League of Legends is perfect both as a casual game with friends and a competitive esport, which is a big reason for its widespread success. In fact, most of the player-base exclusively plays Normal games, and never participates in Ranked at all.</p>

        <br><br><h4> Baby Steps </h4>
        <p class="cardtext">Once you’ve made an account and loaded up the client for the first time, you might feel tempted to jump right into the deep end and start playing immediately. If you are totally clueless though, it’s worth completing the in-game tutorial missions first to get a basic grasp on the controls and mechanics of the game. Experimenting, messing around and learning through your mistakes is the best way to progress at first.</p>
        <p class="cardtext">The tutorial will show you how to use your abilities, walk around the map, and allow you to try out a few different champions. Take your time and give them all a shot so that you can understand what kind of champion you like; do you enjoy ranged marksmen like Miss Fortune or beefy bruisers like Darius? Maybe the agile sword-wielder Master Yi is more your style, or the mobile mage Ahri… Once you complete this first stage of the Tutorial, you’ll have to make your choice between one of the five champions you tried. You’ll receive your favourite for free, as well as a corresponding icon for your account.</p>
        <p class="cardtext">The second and third stages will teach you about items, abilities, levels, gold and farming minions. There’s still a lot to learn, but completing the Tutorial gives you everything you need to head into your first real games on Summoner’s Rift, as well as a capsule containing 3000 precious Blue Essence. This BE can be used in the Store to buy champions you want to try, but choose carefully before spending it. It takes a long time to earn Blue Essence, and even years of consistent play isn’t enough to unlock all of the champions.</p>
        <br><br><img src="Picture Resources/zed.jpg" width="80%" height="12%">
        <br><br><p class="cardtext">Completing the tutorial stages should give your account enough experience to unlock the Practice Tool, which is a sandbox mode for you to experiment in. We’d recommend jumping into it for a few minutes with your chosen champion to get used to their abilities, look around Summoner’s Rift and practice last hitting minions. Now that you’re comfortable, it’s time to move on to your first real match.</p>
